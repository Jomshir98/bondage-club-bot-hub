/** INSTRUCTIONS TO ADD A NEW ROLE
 * Step 1: Add the role variables and according supporting variables to the gameConfig interface, gameConfigs and KidnappersGameRoom class.
 * Step 2: Add a description of that role to the online description of the bot.
 * Step 3: Add role variable inside the function onCharacterEntered() to update the character object on rejoin and add to handleStartCommand().
 * Step 4: If the role has an active ability, add the command to the chat or whisper section of the onMessage() function.
 * Step 5: If the role has an active ability, add instructions on how to use it in the giveNightInstructions() function.
 * Step 6: If the role has an active ability, add the role name to the Set 'roleWarnings' and add the if statement for it in the Tick() function.
 * Step 7: If the role has an active ability, check the early night end condition in the Tick() function
 * Step 8: In the setGameState() function, add the role variable to the if (state === "game_not_started") branch and if the role
 *         has an active ability, set her target to null in the according branch.
 * Step 9: Add the role and according instro to handleMyroleCommand, setAllRolesAndCommunicate() (also edit gameEndMessage) and rollForRoleFrom()
 * Step 10: Think about it, if there are special cases or win conditions with that role that need changes

KIDNAPPERS - The Game
===================================================================
by D. Davidoff / A. Plotkin, room concept by Claudia & Clare, using Jomshir's BotAPI

The game needs five to nine players. 'Kidnappers' is based on a social deduction game to some maybe known as 'Mafia' or 'Werewolf' (modern digital variants are 'Town of Salem' or 'Among us') and is a special variant the bondage club's Kidnappers League sometimes hosts for registered members of the league.

Game flow (will also be explained while you play)
------------------------------------------------------------------
The game is held over the span of several days. Depending on the number of participants in the game, one or two of them will be secretly chosen as this event's kidnappers by the league and will try to kidnap one (two kidnappers cannot kidnap two) of the other participants every night from their bed rooms in the club.
Every following day, all participants will come together and talk about the events from last night, possibly accusing someone of being a kidnapper. If enough agree to start a vote, this club member will have the chance to defend herself and then everyone can cast a vote whether they think she is guilty or not. If a majority agrees that the accused is better kept tied up, or when the time runs out, nightfall will happen again.

Game end
----------------
When all kidnappers are held in strict bondage or the club members no longer stand a chance, the game ends in a win for either the club members or the kidnappers.

Description of all secret roles
----------------------------------------
There are also special roles that are secretly given to some of the participating players according to the game configuration announced at the game start (see later chapter on game configurations):
► The maid role can observe any participant during the night and find out if they are a kidnapper or not.
► The stalker role wins with the kidnapper(s) and can shadow any participant during the night to find out if they are the cute maid
► The mistress role can either prevent herself from being kidnapped or can spend the night with another club member, preventing her from being kidnapped.
► The switch role wins the game for the club members if only her and one kidnapper are left, due to being an undrestimated domme.
► The fan role wants the kidnappers secretly to win, but has no information nor abilities. She wins with the kidnapper(s).
► The masochist role independently wins if she ends up tied up by any of the two sides. It is a neutral role.

Note: Not everyone will have a special role. Some players will be normal club members.

Please only join the game if you have enough time to stay for the full length. That said, please feel free to leave if you got tied up and don't plan to participate in the next game.
Please don't afk in the room or disturb the game!
Enjoy, be fair and respect each other and the rules!


The game commands
===================================================================
Note: All these commands need to be whispered to the bot. Please be mindful that your immersion settings or owner rules may prevent you from being able to whisper.

► !help                  To show a list of these commands into the chat, whisper '!?' or '!help'

► !beepme             To get beeped when enough players for a game are available
► !feedback          To send the message after the command as feedback to the authors
► !freeandleave    To urgently leave, '!freeandleave' will untie you and kick you from the room
► !joingame          To register as a new player, whisper '!joingame'
► !kick                  To start a vote to kick someone from the room: !kick [name] [reason]
► !listvotes           To list all currently running types of votes, e.g. kick votes
► !myrole              To whisper you your assigned role again during a running game
► !skip                  To propose ending a day phase early, whisper '!skip'
► !start                  To start a new round, whisper '!start', after registering. Needs 5+ players
► !status               To get information about the running game, whisper '!status'

Note: There may be some further context-specific commands used during short phases of the game that are not listet here or in the help. Those are announced in-game when relevant.


Game configurations
===================================================================
Depending on the number of registered players at game start, different game configurations will be loaded, which will play very differently. These are all configurations in the game currently (they may be changed once in a while):

"five or six players"
----------------------------
kidnapper: 1
maid: 1
switch: 1
stalker: 1
fan: 0
masochist: 0
mistress: 0
mistressCanProtectHerself: true

openSuspicions: true
firstNightKidnapping: false
discloseRolesAtStart: true

"seven players"
----------------------------
kidnapper: 1

announceMistressProtectionSucess: true
mistressCanpickSameTargetTwice: true
openSuspicions: true
firstNightKidnapping: false
discloseRolesAtStart: true


Weekly game room rotation
===================================
We noticed that running all three of the game rooms in parallel does not work well, due to interested players not waiting if the room is empty but also not sufficiently using the !beepme command for matchmaking purposes. For now, we therefore put the game rooms on a weekly rotation to focus player interest:

Monday         I wouldn't mind
Tuesday        Roleplay Challenge
Wednesday   Kidnappers
Thursday       Roleplay Challenge
Friday            I wouldn't mind
Saturday        Kidnappers + I wouldn't mind
Sunday          Kidnappers + Roleplay Challenge


Contact us
===================================
You can whisper any feedback (including bug reports) for the authors of the room to the bot, by starting your message with '!feedback' (e.g. !feedback I want to tell you that...).
In urgent cases, you can also contact Jomshir, the creator of the bot, on BondageClub discord: Jomshir98#0022

This bot was created using Jomshir's BotAPI.
If you would like to make a bot room similar to this one, you can find all necessary info on the Bondage Club Scripting Community Discord: https://discord.gg/SHJMjEh9VH
