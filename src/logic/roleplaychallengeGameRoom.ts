ROLEPLAY CHALLENGE
===================================================================
a game by Claudia, room concept by Claudia & Clare, using Jomshir's BotAPI

The game offers many randomized roleplay challenges in several million unique variants. It is played with two to three players and is a vehicle to bring more roleplay back to the public rooms of the club. This room may make it easier to meet new people who love to roleplay, like most members did in the early days of the club.

Game flow
---------------------------
In each game round, two to three out of all registered players will be randomly selected and given a random, open roleplay setting that they are supposed to act out improvised, at least 15 minutes long, and for fun and entertainment, with the rest of the players being the audience. So be funny, be silly, be kinky, do it your way! Oh, and feel free to dress according to your roles for extra immersion.

Two minutes before the end of the challenge, every registered player has the chance to vote for prolonging the running roleplay by 10 more minutes if everyone likes the way it is going.

Due to the randomized nature of the challenges, the settings are designed very open and unspecific, sometimes even a bit silly. It is intentional to leave a lot of freedom to fill the scene with your ideas and kinks. Also a dominant role given to a submissive person does not mean she cannot be dommed by the maid who is actually a dominant. You can lead the scene according to your enjoyments as long as everyone is fine with it. It's all about having fun together!

PLEASE RESPECT EACH OTHER'S LIMITS! Therefore, it is recommended to read the profile / character description of the other players and always obey (OOC - out of character) statements in round brackets!

When a challenge has timed out and someone triggers the next challenge with the chat command '!next', please come to an end to not have two roleplays running at the same time in the room.

If you just want to watch and don't join the game, that is fine as long as there are enough registered players, but please don't disturb the roleplay and don't afk in the room! If you have a great idea for a roleplay scenario to add to the game, please leave us feedback.

Enjoy, be fair and respect each other and the rules!


The game commands
===================================================================
Note: All these commands need to be whispered to the bot. Please be mindful that your immersion settings or owner rules may prevent you from being able to whisper.

► !help                  To show a list of these commands into the chat, whisper '!?' or '!help'

► !beepme             To get beeped when enough players for a game are available
► !feedback          To send the message after the command as feedback to the authors
► !joingame          To register as a new player, whisper '!joingame'
► !kick                  To start a vote to kick someone from the room: !kick [name] [reason]
► !leavegame       To unregister yourself from the game and become a spectator (current challenge will go on)
► !listvotes           To list all currently running types of votes, e.g. kick votes
► !next                 To start a new round, whisper '!next', after registering. Needs 2+ players.
                              Number of players is randomized but you can use '!next 3' (or 2) to select it.
► !status              To get information about the running game, whisper '!status'

Note: There may be some further context-specific commands used during short phases of the game that are not listet here or in the help. Those are announced in-game when relevant.


Add your own roleplay challenge to the game
======================================================
We are happy for your propoals on scenes to add to the game in the future. You can write them very freely, but there are some special parts that can be used:

mandatory: {player#} a randomly selected player, this spot will be replaced with the name of the player later
optional: {trait} the trait of a player, will be randomly replaced by something like: shy, stern, grumpy
optional: {role} the role or job of a player, if you want that to be randomly filled
If you want to add your own randomized choices, use the <option1|option2|...> notation anywhere in the text.

Examples of how freely challenges can be written
--------------------------------------------------
• {player1} is a {trait} club member wanting to complain to {player2}, who is a {trait} <club maid|mistress>, about <the selection of toys in the club|loud noises from the other guests in the next room>.

• As 'The Great Houdini', {player1} is well known in the club, always attracting a crowd. This evening, she is once more entertaining the audience with her kinky magic show, asking for volunteers for the the final trick. In the end, she picks {player2}, a {trait} {role}, and {player3}, a {trait} {role}.

• The asylum is a place of many kinky rumours. Today, the {trait} <reporter|lawyer> {player1} was visiting due to a job assignment there, but <got lost on her way out|lost her visiting permit>. She is spotted by the two nurses {player2} and {player3}, the latter one behaving very {trait}.

Note: The challenges are intentionally not too specific, giving some freedom to the roleplayers on what may happen next, not focusing on specific kinks or forcing someone directly and irreversibly into a domme or sub role.

How to send your ideas to us?
-------------------------------------------
Just send it as feedback to us, adding "!feedback " in front of it and whispering it to the bot. When we add it, we will attribute it to your name, telling in-game that it is a challenge by you, unless you don't want that. Looking forward to your roleplay challenge!


Weekly game room rotation
===================================
We noticed that running all three of the game rooms in parallel does not work well, due to interested players not waiting if the room is empty but also not sufficiently using the !beepme command for matchmaking purposes. For now, we therefore put the game rooms on a weekly rotation to focus player interest:

Monday         I wouldn't mind
Tuesday        Roleplay Challenge
Wednesday   Kidnappers
Thursday       Roleplay Challenge
Friday            I wouldn't mind
Saturday        Kidnappers + I wouldn't mind
Sunday          Kidnappers + Roleplay Challenge


Contact us
===================================
You can whisper any feedback (including bug reports) for the authors of the room to the bot, by starting your message with '!feedback' (e.g. !feedback I want to tell you that...).
In urgent cases, you can also contact Jomshir, the creator of the bot, on BondageClub discord: Jomshir98#0022

This bot was created using Jomshir's BotAPI.
If you would like to make a bot room similar to this one, you can find all necessary info on the Bondage Club Scripting Community Discord: https://discord.gg/SHJMjEh9VH
